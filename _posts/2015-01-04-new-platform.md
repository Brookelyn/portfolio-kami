title: Moving to Jekyll
---
For those planning to seek work in the development world after completely their Bloc course, the frontend web developer apprenticeship track includes a portfolio-creating project using Jekyll.

###Unnecessary complexity
The beginning of this project - quite literally, the very first step - did not go well. This is the second time during my course that I'm 95% certain days of frustration and problems, which absolutely would not have been solved without the considerable amount of time my husband put in, were caused by Bloc itself.

Since starting my apprenticeship with Bloc, there have been two fairly major updates to the course curriculum. In themselves, these haven't been a problem and from my understanding have made the course a better, clearer learning path. Understandably, these updates are using the most recent versions of the technologies in question, such as the most up-to-date version of Ruby, for example.

But what I believe the lovely people at Bloc have failed to take into account is that students are asked to set up their development environments in a very specific way using code that Bloc provides - and that students' very often complete lack of background in doing this means that they are simply unable to troubleshoot when problems arise.

The first time this happened was while I was working on Blocitoff, the self-destructing task list project. [Mentor Ben spent a considerable amount of time](https://brookebalza.wordpress.com/2015/09/21/self-destructing-task-list-configuring-the-backend-and-showing-active-tasks/) trying to figure out why I couldn't install Grunt, but it took my husband two solid evenings of investigating the problem before he got it to the point where I could proceed with the project.

The same thing happened when I attempted to install Jekyll at the beginning of this project. I was told that I didn't have the correct versions of several things - including the aforementioned Ruby - and that nothing could happen until everything was updated. Luckily, my husband had set up Jekyll for his company's blog a month or so ago, so was able to get things fixed fairly quickly - but I do think it's just a bit too much to ask students to be able to do on their own.

I really think that Bloc needs to think about this the next time they update their programme roadmaps and offer help to students who have problems moving from one version to the next. After all, Bloc knows what has changed and what needs to be updated much better than a fairly inexperienced student does.

###But I've already got a blog!
When I first applied to Bloc I was lucky enough to be awarded one of their diversity scholarships, which is aimed at getting more women and people of colour into the industry. As part of this, they ask that you blog about your experience of the programme - something that I've been doing on a [semi-regular basis on my free WordPress blog](https://brookebalza.wordpress.com/).

So it came as something of an annoyance to find that the portfolio creation project contained a blog created through Jekyll. I have absolutely no problem using Jekyll intead of Wordpress, but would have liked to have consistency from the beginning - that might be the production editor in me rearing her ugly head, though.

In any case, I'll be blogging here from now on - if I've got anything to say, that is!
