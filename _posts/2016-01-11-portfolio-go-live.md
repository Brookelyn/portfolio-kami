title: Going live with my portfolio
---
Well, I've finally set up my portfolio and made it live!

There's still quite a bit that I'd like to do to the template that Bloc provides its students with at this stage of the course. 

Events seem to be conspiring against me, however, as there have been some quite depressing changes at my paying gig that mean I need to get my CV and portfolio site sorted quite quickly so that I can start looking for a job in development.

###Of course I'm nervous!
One of my friends asked over the weekend whether or not I was nervous about looking for a dev role - and of course I am!

Going to job interviews is nerve-wracking even when you feel like you're fairly established in your career and know what you're doing. But when it's entirely new, and you're not just jumping from university or school into the workforce? It's a bit more intimidating.

I know I've got a lot to learn, which actually makes me feel like I'm a bit ahead of people in their 20s looking for their first proper job - instead of being convinced that I'm shit-hot without anything to back it up, I'm looking for a team to learn from.

One of the things that attracted me to front-end development in the first place is that there's *always* more to learn, and I'm really excited about working in a larger team with more experienced people.

Figuring out how to convince recruiters or HR bods that they want to get the person with the rather unusual background and skill set in to interview, however, is making me rather more worried. Fingers crossed I'll find something soon!
