One Monday morning in June 2014, I walked into my full-time, fairly well-paid job in publishing and informed my manager that I was quitting. I'd had enough of doing a job that I hated - especially one that I'd [accidently fallen into](https://brookebalza.wordpress.com/2015/06/19/an-introduction/) after finishing uni and didn't feel passionate about.

And thus began my dive down the coding rabbit hole - and now there's no going back.

I can't wait until someone pays me to figure out why a div is being pushed out of line, or to spend hours making a particular element look just *so*. I love creating beautifully simple designs that are a pleasure to use and I really do believe that there is no excuse for poor design.

If you think we might work well together, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
