## Introduction

Bloc Jams is the first project in Bloc's frontend web developer apprenticeship. First implemented in basic HTML and CSS, dynamic functionality was added to the page using JQuery and Angular prior to the app being refactored for better appearance on mobile devices. 

The main goal of this project is to introduce students to the fundamentals of front-end web development.

## Problems and solutions

There were a few points in this that were particularly challenging for me. I blogged about these difficulties and how I solved them as I encountered them, and more detail can be found by reading the linked posts below:

## Conclusion

Overall, Bloc Jams provided a useful introduction to front-end development and web design fundamentals. This project included the use of CSS3 animations, media queries and transitions, in addition to HTML, CSS, JQuery and Angular. 

It also covered GitHub basics, introduced how to use the web inspector and deploying to hosting platform Heroku.
