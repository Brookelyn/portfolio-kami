## Introduction

Blocitoff is a to-do list app where each task 'expires' after seven days. Users are able to set the priority of each task, manually remove tasks from the list entirely and mark each task as completed. Tasks are displayed in one of two lists: to do or completed. This was the second project I worked on as part of the Bloc frontend web developer apprenticeship.

## Problems and solutions

The majority of this project was very straightforward for me, with the exception of some set-up problems that I discuss in my post [Self-destructing task list: configuring the backend and showing active tasks](https://brookebalza.wordpress.com/2015/09/21/self-destructing-task-list-configuring-the-backend-and-showing-active-tasks/).

Conditionally setting a class on each task to reflect its priority, however, was significantly more of a struggle. I talk about how I dealt with this in [Wrapping up my self-destructing task list](https://brookebalza.wordpress.com/2015/11/16/wrapping-up-my-self-destructing-task-list/).

## Conclusion

This project was a great introduction to working with the Firebase API, as well as concepts that I'd consider to be a step beyond the basics when it comes to working with Angular.
